# Document Compliance Gateway v4 API

Document Compliance Gateway serves an important role as a router and abstraction layer between Concur core and compliance provider.

Enables Concur core to have a loose coupling with different compliance providers. Brings extensibility into the architecture which would enable integration of new compliance providers in Document Compliance Gateway layer without any changes in the core services. Makes the architecture homogenous for both pull and push model of receipt/invoice compliance. Can perform necessary mappings from a generic document model to Concur Invoice and Concur Expense specific data model for invoice/receipts

#### Notes

1. The company JWT is data center specific. The auth service (/token endpoint) that signs the JWT determines which DC the JWT will work in. It is recommended that the DRC should store the refresh token and use the geolocation response to make subsequent call to the DCG-API
2. To get a token or to refresh a token, use the curl command(s)specified [here](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/getting-started.html). It is recommended to have a valid token and scope to make the post call to DCG API.
3. Once you have the token use the following curl command to POST invoice details
```sh
curl --location --request GET 'https://integration.api.concursolutions.com/document-compliance-gateway/v4/tax-documents/{uuid}' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <JWT token>'
