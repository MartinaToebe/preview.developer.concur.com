## Funds Reservation/Obligation

The use case examples below illustrate Funds and Grants Integration (FGI) scenarios and the related records of Funds Reservation and Funds Check. The use case documentation is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all use cases and FGI scenarios. However, the JSON from FIS will provide all the required data to support all potential financial use cases.

### Funds Reservation on Request

When the Request is created, the employee group configuration is evaluated to determine if FGI is enabled. During the workflow when the Funds Reservation step is reached, the workflow is paused, and a Request Obligation document is made available to the financial system via the FIS API.

#### Example

The Request with one or more Funds Reservation in the Request workflow, linked to one or more Reports.

### Sample Set Up

*	Funds reservation step right after submit.
*	Funds reservation step after Manager approval.

Travel Request with one expense item: Laundry – USD 1200.

**Request Record in the SAP Concur System**

Request ID|	Expense Entry|Amount
---|---|---
FGI1|	Laundry|	$1200

After Request has been submitted, during the Funds Reservation step in the workflow, an Obligation Payload with instruction "obligate" is made available to the financial system via the FIS API.

### Funds Reservation in the Financial System after Submit

Once the Request Obligation Payload with instruction "obligate" is received, the financial system sends acknowledgement back to the SAP Concur system.

[**Acknowledgement JSON Example**](json/FI-API-FundsReservation-ACK-0ba77eb2cf6240beb7dac99632fd6d8a-Example-1.0.0.json)

### Funds Check on Request

When the Request is created, the employee group configuration is evaluated to determine if FGI is enabled. During the workflow when the Funds Check step is reached, the workflow is paused, and a Request Obligation document with instruction "fundsCheck" is made available to the financial system via the FIS API.

#### Examples
